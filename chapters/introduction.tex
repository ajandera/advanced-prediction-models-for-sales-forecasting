\chapter*{Introduction}

Linear prediction is a method used in signal processing to predict future values of a time series based on past observations.
The technique is based on the assumption that the signal can be modeled as a linear combination of past values and a noise term.
Long-term linear prediction refers to the application of this method to predict values over a longer period of time, such as months or years.
It requires a greater amount of data and is more complex than short-term prediction, but can be useful in areas such as stock market forecasting and
weather prediction. The goal of this master thesis is to developing new algorithms and mathematical models to improve the accuracy of long-term predictions
in sales forecasting. Matlab \footnote{MATLAB is a fourth-generation programminglanguage and numerical analysis environment.
Uses for MATLAB include matrix calculations, developing and running algorithms, creating user interfaces (UI) and data visualization.}
livescript~\cite{livescript} will be used as development enviroment.

\section*{Task formulation}

Proposed a mathematical model and alghoritms for sales forcasting based on long-term prediction with improved Levinson - Durbin scheme 
which should have better performance and acuraccy than known linear prediction mechanism.
