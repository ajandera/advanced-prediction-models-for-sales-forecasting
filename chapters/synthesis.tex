\chapter{Syntactic part} \label{sec:methodology}
Based on the Analytical part~\ref{sec:analytical} let us create new mathematical models and approaches to made a fast and accuracy sales forcasting
consist of long-therm linear prediction with individual weights calculated for each period all based on Levinson-Durbin scheme caled Extended linear prediction (ELP)
We expect to get better results than by using prediction based on short-term or long-term standard linear prediction (see section~\ref{sec:lp}).
Finally, our approach will return future values for sales companies based on previous data with better aberration than linear prediction has.
