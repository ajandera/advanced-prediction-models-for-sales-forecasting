abstract = {We present an all-optical neuron that utilizes a logistic sigmoid activation function, using a Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) input \&\#x00026; weighting scheme. The activation function is realized by means of a deeply-saturated differentially-biased Semiconductor Optical Amplifier-Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI) followed by a SOA-Cross-Gain-Modulation (XGM) gate. Its transfer function is both experimentally and theoretically analyzed, showing excellent agreement between theory and experiment and an almost perfect fitting with a logistic sigmoid function. The optical sigmoid transfer function is then exploited in the experimental demonstration of a photonic neuron, demonstrating successful thresholding over a 100psec-long pulse sequence with 4 different weighted-and-summed power levels.},

abstract = {In the last few years, deep learning has led to very good performance on a variety of problems, such as visual recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Leveraging on the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the great improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. We detailize the improvements of CNN on different aspects, including layer design, activation function, loss function, regularization, optimization and fast computation. Besides, we also introduce various applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision, speech and natural language processing.}
